## 3.1 Retrieving a single Pokemon

The `one` method is used to retrieve a single Pokémon by its ID:

```ts
/* GET api/pokemon/1 */
const bulbasaur: Pokemon = await Pokemon.one(1);
```

Optionally you can add a second parameter to define
the query parameters:

```ts
/* GET api/pokemon/1?active=true */
const bulbasaur: Pokemon = await Pokemon.one(42, { active: true });
```

## 3.2 Searching for one Pokemon

The `findOne` method is used to retrieve a single Pokémon based
on query params:

```ts
/* GET api/pokemon?name=bulbasaur */
const bulbasaur = await Pokemon.findOne({ name: 'bulbasaur' });
```

Use when you want to find entities which do not have an ID, rr when
you only want to find a single entity by a custom predicate.

## 3.3 Retrieving a page of Pokemon

The `page` method is used to retrieve a [Page](http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/domain/Page.html) of Pokémon:

```ts
/* GET api/pokemon?page=1 */
const page: Page<Pokemon> = await Pokemon.page({ page: 1 });
```

## 3.4 Retrieving a list of Pokemon

> We recommended using the `page` method whenever possible as it gives you more flexibility and is more memory efficient.

The `list` method is used to retrieve a list of Pokémon:

```ts
/* GET api/pokemon?limit=10 */
const pokemons: Pokemon[] = await Pokemon.list({ limit: 10 });
```

Useful when retrieving a fixed set of data with limited items.

## 3.5 Page vs List

Prefer `page` over `list` when possible because it is more memory efficient
to load only a single slice of the data at a time.

It must also be noted that it is very unlikely that a REST endpoint
supports both `page` and `list` at the same time. So use the variant
which your back-end exposes.

Now that we know how to get data, lets see how we can mutate it.
