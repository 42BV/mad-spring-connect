## 3.1 Retrieving a single Pokemon

Use the `get` method to fetch a single instance of an entity:

```ts
import { get } from '@42.nl/spring-connect';

const POKEMON_API_URL = '/api/pokemon';

type Pokemon = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
};

function onePokemon(id: number) {
  return get<Pokemon>(`${POKEMON_API_URL}/${id}`);
}

const bulbasaur = await onePokemon(42);
```

Optionally you can add a second parameter to define
the query parameters:

```ts
/* GET api/pokemon/1?active=true */
function activePokemon(id: number) {
  return get<Pokemon>(`${POKEMON_API_URL}/${id}`, { active: true });
}
const bulbasaur = await activePokemon(42);
```

## 3.2 Retrieving a page of Pokemon

The [Page](http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/domain/Page.html)
could be used for endpoints that return a Spring page:

```ts
/* GET api/pokemon?page=1 */
function pageOfPokemon(page: number) {
  return get<Page<Pokemon>>(POKEMON_API_URL, { page });
}

const page = await pageOfPokemon(1);
```

## 3.3 Retrieving a list of Pokemon

> We recommended using the `page` method whenever possible as it gives you more flexibility and is more memory efficient.

To retrieve a list of Pok√©mon:

```ts
/* GET api/pokemon?limit=10 */
function listAllPokemon() {
  return get<Pokemon[]>(POKEMON_API_URL);
}
const pokemons = await listOfPokemon();
```

Useful when retrieving a fixed set of data with limited items.

## 3.5 Page vs List

Prefer `page` over `list` when possible because it is more memory efficient
to load only a single slice of the data at a time.

It must also be noted that it is very unlikely that a REST endpoint
supports both `page` and `list` at the same time. So use the variant
which your back-end exposes.
