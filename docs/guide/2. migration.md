We've deprecated `makeResource` and replaced fetch with Axios in v5.
What does that mean for your project?

## 2.1 Deprecated makeResource

### What is a resource?

If you don't know what a resource is, you should read about [Resources](https://42bv.github.io/mad-spring-connect/resource).

### Why deprecate it?

While resources could be very useful, sometimes not all endpoints are supported by the back-end.
You might also have an entity that has some not-nullable properties that are only in the result
when you fetch one, but those properties are not included in the result of the list endpoint.
This means that a front-end developer might be working on a feature and decides to use a specific
property, which is defined in the resource, but somehow the developer gets an error about the
property being undefined. "Is it nullable then, and my colleague forgot to make it optional?".

### Explicit endpoint functions and result types

To prevent this kind of problems, we deprecated `makeResource` and advice developers to make
explicit endpoint functions that perform a call to a specific endpoint and return the corresponding
specific `type`. That would look like this:

```ts
import { get } from '@42.nl/spring-connect';

const USERS_API_URL = '/api/users';

type BasicUserResult = {
  id: number;
  fullName: string;
  age?: number;
};

function getUsers() {
  return get<BasicUserResult>(USERS_API_URL);
}

type UserResult = {
  id: number;
  first_name: string;
  last_name: string;
  birthday?: Date;
};

function getUser(id: number) {
  return get<UserResult>(`${USERS_API_URL}/${id}`);
}
```

## 2.2 Replace fetch with Axios

In previous versions we provided some middleware functions to parse responses and check the status.
Axios has all those features built in, so we don't need the middleware anymore. The authentication
library is also prepared for Axios, so the following code:

```ts
import { configureMadConnect, checkStatus, parseJSON } from '@42.nl/spring-connect';

import { authFetch } from '@42.nl/authentication';

configureMadConnect({
  fetch: authFetch,
  middleware: [checkStatus, parseJSON, displayError],
});
```

can be replaced with:

```ts
import { getXSRFToken, authInterceptor } from '@42.nl/authentication';
import { configureApi } from '@42.nl/spring-connect';
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create();
api.defaults.headers.common['X-XSRF-TOKEN'] = getXSRFToken();
api.defaults.withCredentials = true;
api.interceptors.response.use(undefined, authInterceptor);

configureApi(api);
```
