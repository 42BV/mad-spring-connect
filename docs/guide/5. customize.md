## 5.1 Adding a custom mapper

By default every JSON which is received by the `one`, `findOne`, `page`
and `list` is mapped by this function:

```ts
function defaultMapper<T>(json: JSON, Class: { new (): T }): T {
  return makeInstance(Class, json);
}
```

It simply makes an instance of the class by calling the `makeInstance`
util function with the retrieved JSON.

Sometimes you want to override the default mapper, in the example
below we create a `Pokeball` which contains a pokemon. What we want
is to make the pokemon an actual instance of `Pokemon`. We also want
to store the time of retrieval from the back-end.

```ts
class Pokeball extends makeResource<Pokeball>({
  baseUrl: '/api/pokeball',
  mapper: pokeballMapper,
}) {
  public id?: number;

  /*
    In the actual JSON response pokemon is simply an object.
    But our custom mapper makes sure it will also get mapped.
  */
  public pokemon!: Pokemon;

  /* 
    Does not really exist on the back-end but is filled by the
    custom mapper.
  */
  public retrievedAt!: Date;
}

function pokeballMapper(json: any, Class: { new (): Pokeball }): Pokeball {
  const pokeball = makeInstance(Class, json);
  /* Add a completely new field */
  pokeball.retrievedAt = new Date();

  /* Make the fetched pokemon an actual instance of Pokemon */
  pokeball.pokemon = makeInstance(Pokemon, pokeball.pokemon);

  return pokeball;
}
```

A custom mapper is useful for when the mapping for `one`, `findOne`, `page`
and `list` is exactly the same. If they differ you should instead create
custom methods instead, as explained below.

## 5.2 Adding custom methods on Pokemon

For most situations the default Resource will work just fine, but sometimes you do want to extend and/or customize the available methods from `makeResource`.

The trick here is that this library exposes the same building
blocks that **_makeResource_** uses under the hood. You can use these
building blocks to easily create your own custom methods.

See the [Utils](https://42bv.github.io/mad-spring-connect/utils) section for the
helper functions. It is recommended that you use these functions to help you customize your Resource.

### 5.2.1 adding instance methods

Say you want to add method which retrieves all the evolutions of a Pok√©mon,
this is how you do it:

```ts
import { get, makeInstance, makeResource } from '@42.nl/spring-connect';

const baseUrl = '/api/pokemon';

class Pokemon extends makeResource<Pokemon>(baseUrl) {
  /* shortend the definition of the pokemon class. */

  async evolutions(): Promise<Pokemon[]> {
    if (this.id) {
      /* `get` does a GET request  */
      const list = await get(`${baseUrl}/${this.id}/evolutions`);
      return list.map((properties: JSON) => {
        /* Convert to Pokemon instances */
        return makeInstance(Pokemon, properties);
      });
    }

    return Promise.resolve([]);
  }
}
```

Now you can use it in the following way:

```ts
const bulbasaur = await pokemon.one(1);
const evolutions = await pokemon.evolutions();
```

### 5.2.2 adding static methods

You could also solve this problem with a static method:

```ts
import { get, makeInstance, makeResource } from '@42.nl/spring-connect';

const baseUrl = '/api/pokemon';

class Pokemon extends makeResource<Pokemon>(baseUrl) {
  /* shortend the definition of the pokemon class. */

  static async evolutions(id: number): Promise<Pokemon[]> {
    /* `get` does a GET request */
    const list = await get(`${baseUrl}/${id}/evolutions`);
    return list.map((properties: JSON) => {
      /* Convert to Pokemon instances */
      return makeInstance(Pokemon, properties);
    });
  }
}
```

Which you could use like this:

```ts
const evolutions = await Pokemon.evolutions(1);
```

## 5.3 Overriding methods on Pokemon

Sometimes you will find that the default implementations does not match
your domain. For example there might be a difference between an Entity
in a List / Page or when it is retrieved alone.

### 5.3.1 Overriding instance methods

You can override `save` and `remove` by simply defining them.

This example defines its own custom `save` implementation:

```ts
import { makeResource, post, put, Page } from '@42.nl/spring-connect';
import { merge } from 'lodash';

const baseUrl = '/api/pokemon';

export default class Pokemon extends makeResource<Pokemon>(baseUrl) {
  id!: number;
  trainer!: number;
  name!: string;
  types!: string[];
  weakness!: string[];

  /*
    Here we provide a custom implementation, which always creates
    a new pokemon, and never updates one.
  */
  save(): Promise<Pokemon> {
    return post(baseUrl, this).then((json: any) => {
      return merge(this, json);
    });
  }
}
```

### 5.3.2 Overriding static methods

You can override `one`, `findOne`, `list` and `page` by simply defining them.

This example defines its own custom `page` implementation:

```ts
import { makeResource, get, makeInstance, Page, QueryParams } from '@42.nl/spring-connect';

/* When a pokemon is retrieved in a page it has less info. */
export interface PagePokemon {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

const baseUrl = '/api/pokemon';

export default class Pokemon extends makeResource(baseUrl)<Pokemon> {
  id!: number;
  trainer!: number;
  name!: string;
  types!: string[];
  weakness!: string[];

  /*
    Here we provide a custom implementation, which returns a PagePokemon
    instead of a Pokemon.
  */
  static page<PagePokemon>(queryParams?: QueryParams): Promise<Page<PagePokemon>> {
    return get(baseUrl, queryParams);
  }
}
```
